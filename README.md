# Student-Clearance-form
<p>
I was hired to develop a Student Clearance Form system a full-stack web application designed to automate and streamline the workflow between students and various university departments (Library, Finance, Registrar, etc.)</br>The goal was to create a secure, transparent and user-friendly interface where students could request clearance and track their status in real-time, while department heads could approve or reject requests with a single click.
